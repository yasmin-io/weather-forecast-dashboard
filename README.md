# Weather Forecast

---

I am currently working on building an application for users to view the weather outlook in multiple cities in the `West Midlands`, `United Kingdom`. In my project, I am achieving this by practicing my use of `Third-party APIs` to access the necessary data and functionality. I will be making requests with specific parameters to [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) API then using the return to display and update the correct weather information on my website. The way I am building this, I will need to use [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to display the date as the data URL I chose to use made it easier to receive daily information, however it dosn't come with a date. This is a challenging project for me however, it will also allow me to expand my knowledge in areas I am weak in such as: `Local Storage to build a history search list`.

## Tasks

---

```
You are able to search for a city in a search bar.

The search result presents you with:
- City name
And the current:
- Date
- Icon representation of weather conditions
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- UV index (Color coded to indicate favorable, moderate, or severe conditions.)

You will get a 5-day forecast that will display the following:
- Date
- Icon representation of weather conditions
- Temperature
- Wind speed
- Humidity

Your search is then added to the search history that you are able to click on and search again.
